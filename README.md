# ExectOS-Port

ExectOS Ports (currently Hexa, maybe Zig and Rust in future)

Made with [toHexa](https://github.com/hexalang/toHexa/tree/kawaii/Clang)

## Archiving

[@Belliash](https://github.com/belliash) went offline for many months already... hope he is okay

He was open to the idea of moving from C (and he tried Zig-to-C translation tool but it didn't went well unfortunately)

This repo investigates the idea of producing Clang AST and this way converting to other languages mostly automagically

We tried porting to Hexa first. The rest is history.
